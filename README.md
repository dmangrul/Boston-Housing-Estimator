# Boston-Housing-Estimator
This machine learning program implements Python's Keras Linear Regression algorithm to input information about homes in Boston:

  (Per capita crime rate, Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 square feet, Proportion of non-retail business acres per town, Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise), Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million), Average number of rooms per dwelling, Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940, Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers, Index of accessibility to radial highways, Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000, Pupil-teacher ratio by town, % lower status of the population)

in order to estimate the price of homes. The program first standardizes each of the input parameters (feature scaling), then utilizes SkLearn's linear regression model to output predicted prices and the mean average error to analyze cost and efficacy. This project uses Python and its libraries/frameworks, such as Numpy, StandardScaler, SkLearn, MatPlotLib, Gradient Descent, and Backpropagation.
